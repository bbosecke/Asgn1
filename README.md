This repository involved learning about the Vagrantfile and creating virtual machines (with Vagrant) to interact with eachother. The program allows you to clone the repository and run 'vagrant up' and it will install all the virtual machines, and installations required so it builds "unattended". Accessing the websites is possible with localhost, and ssh into the vm.
